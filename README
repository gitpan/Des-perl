This is the alpha1 release of an extension module for perl5 which provides
a perl interface to a DES library. You need a C DES library to link against,
of course. If you want a good implementation (or don't have a DES library
already), then I can recommend "the Australian libdes" (Eric Young's
implementation) available for anonymous ftp from (amongst other places)
ftp.ox.ac.uk in /pub/crypto/DES/libdes.tar.93-10-08.gz.

If you are using the 5.000 release of perl5, then you'll need to get a
newer version of the ExtUtils::MakeMaker extension which is used to
convert this extension's Makefile.PL into a suitable Makefile.

Documentation for the Des module itself is in pod format in Des.pod.
